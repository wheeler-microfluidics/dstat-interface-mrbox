Version 1.0.2
    -Improved logging system: Log messages now print showing where they came from.
    -Implemented gobject IO callbacks for experiments:
        Process will not continuously poll for new data from serial process anymore.
    -Stop button works again
    -Buttons in Photodiode and Calibration modules remain insensitive until ready.

    -Automatically enable TCS on DStat when measure light sensor button clicked.
    
Version 1.0.3
    -Fixed #14: Added support for PMT idle mode
    -Reduced CPU usage when running OCP by reducing polling frequency
